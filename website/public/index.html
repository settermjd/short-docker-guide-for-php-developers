            So, why another book on Docker — even if it’s a short one?
            </h2>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Here’s why; Hi! I&#8217;m Matthew Setter. I&#8217;ve been developing apps with PHP since about 1999, before it even had object-oriented support. </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">In those days, developing — let alone deploying — apps with PHP was a pretty hairy affair to say the least. While apps worked flawlessly <strong>locally</strong>, in production — not to mention getting it to production — was something else entirely.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Regardless of how I deployed my apps to production it’d be too easy to forget a PHP extension, a source or configuration file, or some other factor on the production servers. </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Sometimes, this resulted in virtually harmless issues. However, it quite often resulted in fatal bugs, because the production copy of the application, or the production environment were different to development.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900"><strong>This caused no end of problems, mud-slinging, and finger-pointing.</strong> </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Over the course of time, I familiarised myself with deployment scripts, and deployment tools, such as
                <em>Capistrano</em>, <em>Make</em>, <em>Ant</em>, <em>Salt</em>, <em>Ansible</em>, and others. However, as good as they are, they didn’t quite fit as neatly as I’d have liked.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Then, alone came Docker. It promised to make all of these issues a thing of the past. I dove on the bandwagon, in the expectation that everything would be fine and our problems would be gone.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">But, like most things, the promise and the reality were a little different.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">I’ll get to the point. While Docker’s an excellent technology, it&#8217;s not always easy to set it up exactly as you need it — especially for PHP developers.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Not sure what I mean? Ever tried debugging a PHP app in a Docker container using PhpStorm or VIM? How long did it take you to get everything working?</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">What has your experience been running your test suites, regardless of whether they’re written in
                <em>PHPUnit</em>, <em>Codeception</em>, or another testing framework?</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Finally, how do you deploy your apps to production (or staging, testing, or any other environment) using Docker, so that the remote environments are the same as development?</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">It’s not always so easy — <span class="font-bold">especially for PHP developers</span>.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Well, over the years, little by little, through a lot of research, hassling friends, trial and error, I found answers to all of these questions, and a number of others. </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">I was able to get everything working and have come to feel confident in my usage of Docker. Given that, I decided to write this book to put all that knowledge into a short guide, so that it’s all in one place — for free!</p>

            <h2 class="mx-auto text-center text-gray-900 text-3xl font-display font-semibold leading-tight mb-10">So What Will The Book Give Me?</h2>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">I'm currently finalising that, and will update this section as soon as the plan is finalised.</p>
            <!--
            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Firstly, I lay out everything that you need to know, to install and configure Docker so that you can get going as quickly as possible. </p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">You’ll learn how to install and configure it so that you’re able to develop, test, and debug your applications, regardless of the application type, and regardless of the text editor or IDE that you’re using,</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">Then, I show you how to debug your container setup, so that you can fix them and get your setup working again.</p>

            <p class="mb-6 text-gray-900">After that, I show you how to deploy your application to a remote environment, such as on a service like
                <em>DigitalOcean</em>, <em>Linode</em>, or <em>SiteGround</em>.</p>
