# Short Docker Guide for PHP Developers

## Overview

The intent of this project is to create a short, **introductory** guide to Docker for PHP developers.
It's **not** intended to be an in-depth, cover everything, or kitchen-sink type of guide.
Rather, the intent is to help developers who are relatively new to Docker achieve two things using Docker:

1. Build a local development environment that does what they need and mirrors remote environments
1. Deploy changed code to production

## What You'll Need

You don't need much to follow along with the short guide, just the following things:

- Docker installed on your operating system of choice
- Either a cloned copy of the book's code (_coming shortly_) or a PHP application that you want to run and deploy using Docker
