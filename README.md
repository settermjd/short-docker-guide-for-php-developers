# Short Docker Guide for PHP Developers

## Overview

The intent of this project is to create a short, **introductory** guide to Docker for PHP developers.
It's **not** intended to be an in-depth, cover everything, or kitchen-sink type of guide.
Rather, the intent is to help developers who are relatively new to Docker achieve two things using Docker:

1. Teach them the essentials of how to build a local development environment using Docker (specifically [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))
1. Teach them how to use relevant Docker tools to deploy code to a remote environment, such as testing, staging, or production

## What You'll Need

You don't need much to follow along with the short guide, just the following things:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your operating system of choice
- Either a cloned copy of the book's code (_coming shortly_) or a PHP application that you want to run and deploy using Docker

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the guide, please read [the Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to find out how.
I'm always open to constructive criticism and helpful improvements.
