= Introduction

Being a developer isn't easy.
While it's a challenge which we love, it's still a tough gig.
Why?
Because there are so many things to learn.

From frameworks and software design patterns to deployment and scaling techniques, to testing, security, and performance demands.
Our time's stretched thin staying abreast of all of these tasks — as well as everything else!
Yet, somehow, we manage to keep our heads above water and survive.

Given all of these competing priorities, the last thing that we want to do is waste our precious time on anything which isn't productive; and two things which aren't productive are:

. Setting up development environments which match remote environments
. Deploying our code to those remote environments

Wouldn't it be easy if we could perform both of these tasks with only a small investment of time and effort?
With Docker, you can.
That's why I wrote this short guide!

== So What is Docker?

That's right - https://www.docker.com/)[Docker].
Docker was initially released back in March of 2013 by a hosting company called _dotCloud_.
dotCloud had been using the tool internally to make their lives easier, managing their hosting business.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)[To quote Wikipedia:]

[quote]
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of Linux applications inside software containers.

Here's a longer description:

[quote]
Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: _code_, _runtime_, _system tools_, _system libraries_ — anything you can install on a server.
This guarantees that it will always execute the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

== Docker Is Simpler

Because of how Docker is designed, it's also a lot less resource and time-intensive.
As the quote above summarizes, Docker containers contain *only* what they need to run your application — nothing more!

You're not building a big virtual machine which will consume a good chunk of your development machine's resources.
You don't have to learn—and write—massive configuration setups to build a basic, working, environment.
You don't need to do much at all, sometimes, to get your application up and running.

Docker allows you to build your application's infrastructure as you would your code.
You determine the parts and services you need and compose them like LEGO blocks.

If you need to change your web or database server, you can switch them one out for another.
If you need to add a caching, logging, or queueing server, you can add an additional container to your existing configuration and keep ongoing.
It can be that simple.

Sound enticing?
I hope so.

== Why This Book?

Hopefully, the above introduction explained the "why" of this book.
However, just in case it didn't, let me be more specific.
I love using Docker to build and deploy PHP applications.
Since I started using it, it's greatly reduced the effort required to build development environments and to deploy applications to remote environments.
Given that these two tasks are still ones that I hear other developers feel frustrated by, I wanted to share how to make them easier with Docker, based on my own experience.

== Who Is This Book For?

Is this guide for you? 
Here are three, somewhat long-winded questions, that can help you answer it:

* Have you experimented with all manner of tools and processes for building your local and remote environments, and for deploying local changes to those remote environments, and want a process that is, for the most part, simple?
* Have you heard of Docker and want to get an idea of what it is and how it can help you build PHP applications with less time and effort?
* Have you tried to use Docker to do build environments and deploy applications, but hit one brick wall after another?

If you can answer yes to at least one of these questions, then this guide is for you.
It's not an exhaustive guide. 
Rather, it's a short one, designed to get you up and running, while giving you a path to learn more once you've mastered these two essential tasks.
