= Introduction

Being a developer isn't easy.
While it's a challenge which we love, it's still a tough gig.
Why?
Because there are so many things to learn.

From frameworks and software design patterns to deployment and scaling techniques, to testing, security, and performance demands.
Our time's stretched thin staying abreast of all of these tasks — as well as everything else!
Yet, somehow, we manage to keep our heads above water and survive.

Given all of these competing priorities, the last thing that we want to do is waste our precious time on anything which isn't productive; and two things which aren't productive are:

. Setting up development environments which match remote environments
. Deploying our code to those remote environments

Wouldn't it be easy if we could perform both of these tasks with only a small investment of time and effort?
With Docker, you can.
That's why I wrote this short guide!

== So What is Docker?

That's right - https://www.docker.com/)[Docker].
Docker was initially released back in March of 2013 by a hosting company called _dotCloud_.
dotCloud had been using the tool internally to make their lives easier, managing their hosting business.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)[To quote Wikipedia:]

[quote]
Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of Linux applications inside software containers.

Here's a longer description:

[quote]
Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: _code_, _runtime_, _system tools_, _system libraries_ — anything you can install on a server.
This guarantees that it will always execute the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

Because of how Docker is designed, it's also a lot less resource and time-intensive.
As the quote above summarizes, Docker containers contain *only* what they need to run your application — nothing more!

You're not building a big virtual machine which will consume a good chunk of your development machine's resources.
You don't have to learn—and write—massive configuration setups to build a basic, working, environment.
You don't need to do much at all, sometimes, to get your application up and running.

Docker allows you to build your application's infrastructure as you would your code.
You determine the parts and services you need and compose them like LEGO blocks.

Actually, a better way to think of it is like a cargo ship on the sea, which carries shipping containers around the world.
It doesn't matter what is inside the container (more or less).
What's important is that they're a standardised container which can be put on virtually any ship bound for any port.
If one ship can't carry them, then another one can.

And so it is with Docker.
When you use Docker, you can build your application based on one or more containers, and then deploy that setup to any hosting service that supports Docker.
If that service goes out of business, increases its prices too steeply, or its support is too lousy, you can then redeploy your application to another host that supports Docker.

At the application level, if you need to change your web or database server, you can switch them one out for another.
If you need to scale them out, you can add more containers to your configuration.
If you need to add a caching, logging, or queueing server, you can add additional containers to your configuration.
It can be that simple.

Sound enticing?
*I hope so!*
