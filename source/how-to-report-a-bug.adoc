= How to Report a Bug

If you find a bug in any of the code here in the book, you can:

- Email me at mailto:matthew@matthewsetter.com[matthew@matthewsetter.com].
- Submit a https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request[pull request (PR)].

As soon as it is possible after I receive any bug notifications, the code will be corrected, and a new version of the book will be published.
