= Essential Terminology

Before we dive in to creating a local development environment using Docker, there is some essential terminology that you need to be aware of.
I'll keep it as short as I can.

== [Docker Image]

Quoting https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=image[the Docker Glossary]:

[quote]
----
Docker images are the basis of containers. 
An Image is an ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container runtime. 
An image typically contains a union of layered filesystems stacked on top of each other. 
An image does not have state and it never changes.

== Docker Container

Again quoting https://docs.docker.com/glossary/?term=container#container[the Docker Glossary]:

[quote]
----
A container is a runtime instance of a docker image.
A Docker container consists of

- A Docker image
- An execution environment
- A standard set of instructions

The concept is borrowed from Shipping Containers, which define a standard to ship goods globally. Docker defines a standard to ship software.
