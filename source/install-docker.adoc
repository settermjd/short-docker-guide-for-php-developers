= So How Do I Install Docker?

== Using Linux?

I'll assume that you don't have Docker installed on your local machine.
If not, and you're using a Linux distribution, then use its package manager to install Docker.

== Using macOS or Windows?

If you're not using Linux, then grab a copy of https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/[Docker for Mac] or https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/windows[Docker for Windows], depending which platform you're using.
The installers do an excellent job of making the setup pretty painless.

With Docker installed, we're now able to start building our local development environment.
