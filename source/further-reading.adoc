= Further Reading

This was not an extensive guide to Docker, rather, a short, introductory guide.
That said, if you've read this far, I'm sure that you want to learn more.
If so, I strongly encourage you to check out one of the following resources:

- {learning-containers-url}[Learning Containers], by Chris Tankersley
- {shipping-docker-url}[Shipping Docker] by Chris Fidao; or
- {docker-for-devs-url}[Docker for Developers]

They're all excellent resources!
